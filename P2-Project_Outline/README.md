## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Granblue Fantasy is a fairly popular mobile game with 25million players. It has a deep and complex skill system with multiple ways to play. On the flip side, its hard to navigate the menus and keep track of all the skills and characters at your disposal. I am to create an app that is a simple way to visually organize the players party and keep track of important skill effects.

I personally spend a good amount of time playing this game and have always been frustrated with how hard it is to optimize my gameplay. I believe an app like this would make it much easier to formulate game plans and varied party builds, ultimately leading to a deeper and more engaging experience.
